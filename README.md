Personal web !! you can fork if you like the work please do not copy because i worked so hard on it :) 

steps are so simple 
- Fork this repo 
- change index.html (put your name and all)
- then move 2 CSS add your color theme 
last i will reccomend you to use VS Code in doing this but you can do the same while in the github without closing your web (github)

## Thank you :)
